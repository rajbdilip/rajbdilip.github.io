So my proposal for [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) 2016 was accepted and I was one of the 1206 Google student developers all around the globe. I got a chance to work on [CiviCRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CiviCRM) alongside its developers from all around the world. CiviCRM is a web-based, open source constituency relationship management specifically designed for the needs of non-profit, non-governmental, and advocacy groups, and serves as an association management system. Volunteers, activists, voters as well as more general sorts of business contacts such as employees, clients, or vendors can be managed using CiviCRM.

My project was titled "[Social Media Integration](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5737064465170432)" and the project aimed to boost the exposure of CiviCRM as a platform and make it even easier for people to connect. Specifically, I had to develop an extension to CiviCRM that would allow users to more easily fill forms and sign petitions using social login. It would also allow event registrations in CiviCRM to be reflected in RSVPs for parallel Facebook events. Moreover, it would allow CiviCRM admins to integrate multiple social networks and pull any relevant users activity data.

The coding began on May 22, 2016 and went through August 23, 2016. By the end of the program, most of the project goals were met with a few pending updates. Exact features of the extension can be found [here](https://github.com/rajbdilip/org.civicrm.civisocial#civisocial---social-media-integration). The extension is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/rajbdilip/org.civicrm.civisocial). The installation and configuration instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/rajbdilip/org.civicrm.civisocial/blob/master/README.md).

I will further work on the extension to add more features. Any code contributions or feature suggestions are welcome.
