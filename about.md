## Hello!

I'm Dilip Raj Baral.

I'm an Engineer.

I believe computers and technology can make the world a better place.

I speak Java, PHP, Swift, JavaScript, and a few other languages.

I love music. These are some of my all-time favorites:

- The Script - The Man Who Can't be Moved
- James Blunt - You're Beautiful
- Coldplay - Yellow
- Angus and Julia Stone - For You

Sci-Fi is love. "Inception" and "Interstellar" blew my mind. I'm a huge Marvel fan. I even idolize Tony Stark. DC? She said, "You're not a DC fan, you are just trying hard to be." The Dark Knight trilogy, though.

While not living science fiction, I look up to Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and a few other college dropouts.

I'm [@rajbdilip](https://x.com/rajbdilip) on X and [rajbdilip](https://github.com/rajbdilip) on GitHub.
