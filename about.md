I’m Dilip Raj Baral, a software engineer who still believes computers can make the world a little better (and occasionally funnier).

## 2015 Me (the time capsule)

- Hi! I'm an Engineer!
- I believe computers and technology can make the world a better place.
- I speak Java, PHP, Swift, JavaScript, and a few other languages.
- I love music. These are some of my all-time favorites:
  - _The Man Who Can't be Moved_ by **The Script** 
  - _You're Beautiful_ by **James Blunt**
  - _Yellow_ by **Coldplay**
  - _For You_ by **Angus and Julia Stone**
  - Sci-Fi is love.
    - _Inception_ and _Interstellar_ blew my mind.
    - I'm a huge Marvel fan. I even idolize Tony Stark.
    - DC? She said, _"You're not a DC fan, you are just trying hard to be."_ The Dark Knight trilogy, though.
- While not living science fiction I look up to Elon Musk, Steve Jobs and a few other college dropouts.

## 2025 Me (the upgrade)

- Hey! I’m still an Engineer specializing in Payments Tech — the part of the internet where a single misplaced decimal point becomes a national emergency. 
- I believe docs and clean code make the world even better.
- Java (and vibe coding) is the bread and butter. Everything else is “soft” skills (and therapy).
- New music favorites join the list, but the 2015 "all-time" ones can’t be moved — unlike my gym schedule.
- Sci‑Fi is still life, but the industry fatigue is real.
  - Nolan, can you do Superhero too, please?
  - Took a Marvel guy to fix DC (and now Netflix)
  - Robert Downey Jr. returning as a villain to save the MCU (🤭) - My 2015 Tony Stark poster is currently having an identity crisis.
- Can I drop back _into_ college? Asking for a friend!
